To do this, depower the board, then hold the BOOTSEL button down during board power-up (e.g. hold BOOTSEL down while connecting the USB). The Pico will then appear  as  a  USB  Mass  Storage  Device.  Dragging  a  special  '.uf2'  file  onto  the  disk  will  write  this  file  to  the  Flash  and restart the Pico.\\nThe USB boot code is stored in ROM on RP2040, so can not be accidentally overwritten.\\nTo get started using the SWD port see the Debugging with SWD section in the Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico book.\\n4.2. General purpose I/O\\nThe Raspberry Pi Pico’s GPIO is powered from the on-board 3.3V rail and is therefore fixed at 3.3V.\\nThe Pico exposes 26 of the 30 possible RP2040 GPIO pins by routing them straight out to Pico header pins.

Powering Pico\\nThe simplest way to power Pico is to plug in the micro-USB, which will power VSYS (and therefore the system) from the 5V USB VBUS voltage, via D1 (so VSYS becomes VBUS minus the Schottky diode drop).\\nIf the USB port is the only power source, VSYS and VBUS can be safely shorted together to eliminate the Schottky diode drop (which improves efficiency and reduces ripple on VSYS).\\nIf the USB port is not going to be used, it is safe to power Pico by connecting VSYS to your preferred power source (in the range ~1.8V to 5.5V).\\n\\uf06a IMPORTANT\\nIf you are using Raspberry Pi Pico in USB Host mode (e.g. using one of the TinyUSB host examples) then you must\\npower Pico by providing 5V to the VBUS pin.\\nThe simplest way to safely add a second power source to Pico is to feed it into VSYS via another Schottky diode (see Figure 15). This will 'OR' the two voltages, allowing the higher of either the external voltage or VBUS to power VSYS, with the diodes preventing either supply from back-powering the other. For example a single Lithium-Ion cell* (cell voltage ~3.0V to 4.2V) will work well, as will 3×AA series cells (~3.0V to ~4.8V) and any other fixed supply in the range ~2.3V to 5.5V. The downside of this approach is that the second power supply will suffer a diode drop in the same way as VBUS does, and this may not be desirable from an efficiency perspective or if the source is already close to the lower range of input voltage allowed for the RT6150.\\nAn improved way to power from a\", doc_id='36537453-d006-4303-9baa-9ab177d14d4c', embedding=None, doc_hash='8b523b6777b3b2f175d4e75f0a0e7367172417d8078e1303800892537651c73a', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 36076, 'end': 37746}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'a019bc98-a3c8-4aa8-8238-32c7545e999d'}), score=1000.0), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text=\"cells  they  must  have,  or  be  provided  with,  adequate  protection  against  over-discharge,  over-\\ncharge, charging outside allowed temperature range, and overcurrent.

Using a battery charger\\nPico can also be used with a battery charger. Although this is a slightly more complex use case it is still straightforward. Figure 17 shows an example of using a 'Power Path' type charger (where the charger seamlessly manages swapping between powering from battery or powering from the input source and charging the battery, as needed).\\nIn the example we feed VBUS to the input of the charger, and we feed VSYS with the output via the previously mentioned P-FET  arrangement.  Depending  on  your  use  case  you  may  also  want  to  add  a  Schottky  diode  across  the  P-FET  as described in the previous section.\\n4.7. USB\\nRP2040 has an integrated USB1.1 PHY and controller which can be used in both Device and Host mode. Pico adds the two required 27Ω external resistors and brings this interface to a standard micro-USB port.\\nThe USB port can be used to access the USB bootloader (BOOTSEL mode) stored in the RP2040 boot ROM. It can also be used by user code, to access an external USB device or host.\\n4.8. Debugging\\nRaspberry Pi Pico brings the RP2040 Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface to a 3 pin debug header on the lower edge of the  board.  To  get  started  using  the  debug  port  see  the  Debugging  with  SWD  section  in  the  Getting  started  with Raspberry Pi Pico book.\\n\\uf05a NOTE\\nThe RP2040 chip has internal pull up resistors on the SWDIO and SWCLK pins, both nominally\", doc_id='19b3788e-26e8-4452-839c-b779b571432e', embedding=None, doc_hash='d6c49136450c835aa1df8205b378efca1389a703167ac7f10d006eeedfda1fcf', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 40978, 'end': 42765}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'a019bc98-a3c8-4aa8-8238-32c7545e999d'}), score=1000.0), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text='Risk Activities and accepts no liability for use or inclusions of Raspberry Pi products in High Risk Activities.\\nRaspberry  Pi  products  are  provided  subject  to  RPL’s  Standard  Terms.

General purpose I/O\\nThe Raspberry Pi Pico’s GPIO is powered from the on-board 3.3V rail and is therefore fixed at 3.3V.\\nThe Pico exposes 26 of the 30 possible RP2040 GPIO pins by routing them straight out to Pico header pins. GPIO0 to GPIO22  are  digital  only  and  GPIO  26-28  are  able  to  be  used  either  as  digital  GPIO  or  as  ADC  inputs  (software selectable).\\nOne thing to note is that the ADC capable GPIO26-29 have an internal reverse diode to the VDDIO (3V3) rail and so the input voltage must not exceed VDDIO plus about 300mV. Also, if the RP2040 is unpowered, applying a voltage to these GPIO pins will 'leak' through the diode into the VDDIO rail. Normal digital GPIO pins 0-25 (and also the debug pins) do not have this restriction and therefore voltage can safely be applied to these pins when RP2040 is unpowered.\\n4.3. Using the ADC\\nThe RP2040 ADC does not have an on-board reference and therefore uses its own power supply as a reference. On Pico the ADC_AVDD pin (the ADC supply) is generated from the SMPS 3.3V by using an R-C filter (201Ω into 2.2μF). This is a simple solution but does have the following drawbacks:\\n1. We are relying on the 3.3V SMPS output accuracy which isn’t great\\n2. We can only do so much filtering and therefore ADC_AVDD will be\", doc_id='27c5a45a-e703-4f71-9b11-59ff12589757', embedding=None, doc_hash='28bd0c182c4933599c1bb7aaf56b18c34c588e1b2cd98b1fd03c31098e234125', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 26081, 'end': 27716}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'a019bc98-a3c8-4aa8-8238-32c7545e999d'}), score=1000.0), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text=\"The following are knowledge triplets in the form of (subset, predicate, object):\\n('RP2040', 'has', '264kB multi-bank high performance SRAM')\\n('RP2040', 'has', 'Serial Wire Debug interface')\\n('RP2040', 'has', 'VSYS')\\n('RP2040', 'has', 'dual-core cortex M0+')\\n('RP2040', 'has', '26 GPIO pins')\\n('Raspberry Pi Pico W', 'has been designed to be', 'low cost yet flexible development platform for RP2040')\\n('RP2040', 'has', 'ADC')\\n('Raspberry Pi Pico', 'is based on', 'Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller chip')\\n('RP2040', 'has', '30 possible GPIO pins')\\n('Raspberry Pi Pico W', 'has been designed to be a low cost yet flexible development platform for', 'RP2040')\\n('RP2040', 'has', 'integrated USB1.1 PHY and controller')\\n('RP2040', 'has', 'VBUS')\\n('RP2040', 'has', 'GPIO')\\n('RP2040', 'has', 'on-chip linear regulator')\\n('RP2040', 'powers', 'digital core')\\n('RP2040', 'is', 'microcontroller')\\n('RP2040', 'has', 'USB1.1 PHY and controller')\", doc_id='abe2c965-88e2-44dd-bdc0-40520762c0e7', embedding=None, doc_hash='71e80e0d426d7429322f3e451ac004e2d1550753077021d1115d2ac9cb9ceec0', extra_info=None, node_info={'kg_rel_texts': [\"('RP2040', 'has', '264kB multi-bank high performance SRAM')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'Serial Wire Debug interface')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'VSYS')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'dual-core cortex M0+')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', '26 GPIO pins')\", \"('Raspberry Pi Pico W', 'has been designed to be', 'low cost yet flexible development platform for RP2040')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'ADC')\", \"('Raspberry Pi Pico', 'is based on', 'Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller chip')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', '30 possible GPIO pins')\", \"('Raspberry Pi Pico W', 'has been designed to be a low cost yet flexible development platform for', 'RP2040')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'integrated USB1.1 PHY and controller')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'VBUS')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'GPIO')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'on-chip linear regulator')\", \"('RP2040', 'powers', 'digital core')\", \"('RP2040', 'is', 'microcontroller')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'USB1.1 PHY and controller')\"], 'kg_rel_map': {'platform': [], 'development': [], 'RP2040': [('microcontroller', 'is'), ('dual-core cortex M0+', 'has'), ('264kB multi-bank high performance SRAM', 'has'), ('GPIO', 'has'), ('VBUS', 'has'), ('VSYS', 'has'), ('integrated USB1.1 PHY and controller', 'has'), ('26 GPIO pins', 'has'), ('30 possible GPIO pins', 'has'), ('ADC', 'has'), ('on-chip linear regulator', 'has'), ('digital core', 'powers'), ('USB1.1 PHY and controller', 'has'), ('Serial Wire Debug interface', 'has')], 'cheap': []}}, relationships={}), score=1000.0)], extra_info={'kg_rel_texts': [\"('RP2040', 'has', '264kB multi-bank high performance SRAM')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'Serial Wire Debug interface')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'VSYS')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'dual-core cortex M0+')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', '26 GPIO pins')\", \"('Raspberry Pi Pico W', 'has been designed to be', 'low cost yet flexible development platform for RP2040')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'ADC')\", \"('Raspberry Pi Pico', 'is based on', 'Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller chip')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', '30 possible GPIO pins')\", \"('Raspberry Pi Pico W', 'has been designed to be a low cost yet flexible development platform for', 'RP2040')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'integrated USB1.1 PHY and controller')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'VBUS')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'GPIO')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'on-chip linear regulator')\", \"('RP2040', 'powers', 'digital core')\", \"('RP2040', 'is', 'microcontroller')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'USB1.1 PHY and controller')\"], 'kg_rel_map': {'platform': [], 'development': [], 'RP2040': [('microcontroller', 'is'), ('dual-core cortex M0+', 'has'), ('264kB multi-bank high performance SRAM', 'has'), ('GPIO', 'has'), ('VBUS', 'has'), ('VSYS', 'has'), ('integrated USB1.1 PHY and controller', 'has'), ('26 GPIO pins', 'has'), ('30 possible GPIO pins', 'has'), ('ADC', 'has'), ('on-chip linear regulator', 'has'), ('digital core', 'powers'), ('USB1.1 PHY and controller', 'has'), ('Serial Wire Debug interface', 'has')], 'cheap': []}})"

Programming the flash\\nThe  on-board  2MB  QSPI  Flash  can  be  (re)programmed  either  using  the  Serial  Wire  Debug  port  or  by  the  special  USB Mass Storage Device mode.\\nThe simplest way to reprogram the Pico’s Flash is to use the USB mode. To do this, depower the board, then hold the BOOTSEL button down during board power-up (e.g. hold BOOTSEL down while connecting the USB). The Pico will then appear  as  a  USB  Mass  Storage  Device.  Dragging  a  special  '.uf2'  file  onto  the  disk  will  write  this  file  to  the  Flash  and restart the Pico.\\nThe USB boot code is stored in ROM on RP2040, so can not be accidentally overwritten.\\nTo get started using the SWD port see the Debugging with SWD section in the Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico book.\\n4.2.

Powering Pico\\nThe simplest way to power Pico is to plug in the micro-USB, which will power VSYS (and therefore the system) from the 5V USB VBUS voltage, via D1 (so VSYS becomes VBUS minus the Schottky diode drop).\\nIf the USB port is the only power source, VSYS and VBUS can be safely shorted together to eliminate the Schottky diode drop (which improves efficiency and reduces ripple on VSYS).\\nIf the USB port is not going to be used, it is safe to power Pico by connecting VSYS to your preferred power source (in the range ~1.8V to 5.5V).\\n\\uf06a IMPORTANT\\nIf you are using Raspberry Pi Pico in USB Host mode (e.g. using one of the TinyUSB host examples) then you must\\npower Pico by providing 5V to the VBUS pin.\\nThe simplest way to safely add a second power source to Pico is to feed it into VSYS via another Schottky diode (see Figure 15). This will 'OR' the two voltages, allowing the higher of either the external voltage or VBUS to power VSYS, with the diodes preventing either supply from back-powering the other. For example a single Lithium-Ion cell* (cell voltage ~3.0V to 4.2V) will work well, as will 3×AA series cells (~3.0V to ~4.8V) and any other fixed supply in the range ~2.3V to 5.5V. The downside of this approach is that the second power supply will suffer a diode drop in the same way as VBUS does, and this may not be desirable from an efficiency perspective or if the source is already close to the lower range of input voltage allowed for the RT6150.\\nAn improved way to power from a\", doc_id='36537453-d006-4303-9baa-9ab177d14d4c', embedding=None, doc_hash='8b523b6777b3b2f175d4e75f0a0e7367172417d8078e1303800892537651c73a', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 36076, 'end': 37746}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'a019bc98-a3c8-4aa8-8238-32c7545e999d'}), score=1000.0), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text=\"cells  they  must  have,  or  be  provided  with,  adequate  protection  against  over-discharge,  over-\\ncharge, charging outside allowed temperature range, and overcurrent.

Using a battery charger\\nPico can also be used with a battery charger. Although this is a slightly more complex use case it is still straightforward. Figure 17 shows an example of using a 'Power Path' type charger (where the charger seamlessly manages swapping between powering from battery or powering from the input source and charging the battery, as needed).\\nIn the example we feed VBUS to the input of the charger, and we feed VSYS with the output via the previously mentioned P-FET  arrangement.  Depending  on  your  use  case  you  may  also  want  to  add  a  Schottky  diode  across  the  P-FET  as described in the previous section.\\n4.7. USB\\nRP2040 has an integrated USB1.1 PHY and controller which can be used in both Device and Host mode. Pico adds the two required 27Ω external resistors and brings this interface to a standard micro-USB port.\\nThe USB port can be used to access the USB bootloader (BOOTSEL mode) stored in the RP2040 boot ROM. It can also be used by user code, to access an external USB device or host.\\n4.8.

GPIO0 to GPIO22  are  digital  only  and  GPIO  26-28  are  able  to  be  used  either  as  digital  GPIO  or  as  ADC  inputs  (software selectable).\\nOne thing to note is that the ADC capable GPIO26-29 have an internal reverse diode to the VDDIO (3V3) rail and so the input voltage must not exceed VDDIO plus about 300mV. Also, if the RP2040 is unpowered, applying a voltage to these GPIO pins will 'leak' through the diode into the VDDIO rail. Normal digital GPIO pins 0-25 (and also the debug pins) do not have this restriction and therefore voltage can safely be applied to these pins when RP2040 is unpowered.\\n4.3. Using the ADC\\nThe RP2040 ADC does not have an on-board reference and therefore uses its own power supply as a reference. On Pico the ADC_AVDD pin (the ADC supply) is generated from the SMPS 3.3V by using an R-C filter (201Ω into 2.2μF). This is a simple solution but does have the following drawbacks:\\n1. We are relying on the 3.3V SMPS output accuracy which isn’t great\\n2.

To do this, depower the board, then hold the BOOTSEL button down during board power-up (e.g. hold BOOTSEL down while connecting the USB). The Pico will then appear  as  a  USB  Mass  Storage  Device.

Powering Pico\\nThe simplest way to power Pico is to plug in the micro-USB, which will power VSYS (and therefore the system) from the 5V USB VBUS voltage, via D1 (so VSYS becomes VBUS minus the Schottky diode drop).\\nIf the USB port is the only power source, VSYS and VBUS can be safely shorted together to eliminate the Schottky diode drop (which improves efficiency and reduces ripple on VSYS).\\nIf the USB port is not going to be used, it is safe to power Pico by connecting VSYS to your preferred power source (in the range ~1.8V to 5.5V).\\n\\uf06a IMPORTANT\\nIf you are using Raspberry Pi Pico in USB Host mode (e.g. using one of the TinyUSB host examples) then you must\\npower Pico by providing 5V to the VBUS pin.\\nThe simplest way to safely add a second power source to Pico is to feed it into VSYS via another Schottky diode (see Figure 15). This will 'OR' the two voltages, allowing the higher of either the external voltage or VBUS to power VSYS, with the diodes preventing either supply from back-powering the other. For example a single Lithium-Ion cell* (cell voltage ~3.0V to 4.2V) will work well, as will 3×AA series cells (~3.0V to ~4.8V) and any other fixed supply in the range ~2.3V to 5.5V. The downside of this approach is that the second power supply will suffer a diode drop in the same way as VBUS does, and this may not be desirable from an efficiency perspective or if the source is already close to the lower range of input voltage allowed for the RT6150.\\nAn improved way to power from a\", doc_id='36537453-d006-4303-9baa-9ab177d14d4c', embedding=None, doc_hash='8b523b6777b3b2f175d4e75f0a0e7367172417d8078e1303800892537651c73a', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 36076, 'end': 37746}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'a019bc98-a3c8-4aa8-8238-32c7545e999d'}), score=1000.0), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text=\"cells  they  must  have,  or  be  provided  with,  adequate  protection  against  over-discharge,  over-\\ncharge, charging outside allowed temperature range, and overcurrent.

Using a battery charger\\nPico can also be used with a battery charger. Although this is a slightly more complex use case it is still straightforward. Figure 17 shows an example of using a 'Power Path' type charger (where the charger seamlessly manages swapping between powering from battery or powering from the input source and charging the battery, as needed).\\nIn the example we feed VBUS to the input of the charger, and we feed VSYS with the output via the previously mentioned P-FET  arrangement.  Depending  on  your  use  case  you  may  also  want  to  add  a  Schottky  diode  across  the  P-FET  as described in the previous section.\\n4.7. USB\\nRP2040 has an integrated USB1.1 PHY and controller which can be used in both Device and Host mode. Pico adds the two required 27Ω external resistors and brings this interface to a standard micro-USB port.\\nThe USB port can be used to access the USB bootloader (BOOTSEL mode) stored in the RP2040 boot ROM. It can also be used by user code, to access an external USB device or host.\\n4.8. Debugging\\nRaspberry Pi Pico brings the RP2040 Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface to a 3 pin debug header on the lower edge of the  board.

General purpose I/O\\nThe Raspberry Pi Pico’s GPIO is powered from the on-board 3.3V rail and is therefore fixed at 3.3V.\\nThe Pico exposes 26 of the 30 possible RP2040 GPIO pins by routing them straight out to Pico header pins. GPIO0 to GPIO22  are  digital  only  and  GPIO  26-28  are  able  to  be  used  either  as  digital  GPIO  or  as  ADC  inputs  (software selectable).\\nOne thing to note is that the ADC capable GPIO26-29 have an internal reverse diode to the VDDIO (3V3) rail and so the input voltage must not exceed VDDIO plus about 300mV. Also, if the RP2040 is unpowered, applying a voltage to these GPIO pins will 'leak' through the diode into the VDDIO rail. Normal digital GPIO pins 0-25 (and also the debug pins) do not have this restriction and therefore voltage can safely be applied to these pins when RP2040 is unpowered.\\n4.3. Using the ADC\\nThe RP2040 ADC does not have an on-board reference and therefore uses its own power supply as a reference. On Pico the ADC_AVDD pin (the ADC supply) is generated from the SMPS 3.3V by using an R-C filter (201Ω into 2.2μF). This is a simple solution but does have the following drawbacks:\\n1. We are relying on the 3.3V SMPS output accuracy which isn’t great\\n2. We can only do so much filtering and therefore ADC_AVDD will be\", doc_id='27c5a45a-e703-4f71-9b11-59ff12589757', embedding=None, doc_hash='28bd0c182c4933599c1bb7aaf56b18c34c588e1b2cd98b1fd03c31098e234125', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 26081, 'end': 27716}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'a019bc98-a3c8-4aa8-8238-32c7545e999d'}), score=1000.0), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text='charger, and we feed VSYS with the output via the previously mentioned P-FET  arrangement.

USB\\nRP2040 has an integrated USB1.1 PHY and controller which can be used in both device and host mode. Pico W adds the two required 27Ω external resistors and brings this interface to a standard micro-USB port.\\nThe USB port can be used to access the USB bootloader (BOOTSEL mode) stored in the RP2040 boot ROM. It can also be used by user code, to access an external USB device or host.\\n3.8. Wireless interface\\nPico W contains an on-board 2.4GHz wireless interface using the Infineon CYW43439, which has the following features:\\n• WiFi 4 (802.11n), Single-band (2.4 GHz)\\n• WPA3\\n• SoftAP (Up to 4 clients)\\nThe antenna is an onboard antenna licensed from ABRACON (formerly ProAnt). The wireless interface is connected via SPI to the RP2040.\\nDue  to  pin  limitations,  some  of  the  wireless  interface  pins  are  shared.  The  CLK  is  shared  with  VSYS  monitor,  so  only when there isn’t an SPI transaction in progress can VSYS be read via the ADC. The Infineon CYW43439 DIN/DOUT and IRQ all share one pin on the RP2040. Only when an SPI transaction isn’t in progress is it suitable to check for IRQs.

Programming the flash\\nThe  on-board  2MB  QSPI  Flash  can  be  (re)programmed  either  using  the  Serial  Wire  Debug  port  or  by  the  special  USB Mass Storage Device mode.\\nThe simplest way to reprogram the Pico’s Flash is to use the USB mode. To do this, depower the board, then hold the BOOTSEL button down during board power-up (e.g. hold BOOTSEL down while connecting the USB). The Pico will then appear  as  a  USB  Mass  Storage  Device.  Dragging  a  special  '.uf2'  file  onto  the  disk  will  write  this  file  to  the  Flash  and restart the Pico.\\nThe USB boot code is stored in ROM on RP2040, so can not be accidentally overwritten.\\nTo get started using the SWD port see the Debugging with SWD section in the Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico book.\\n4.2. General purpose I/O\\nThe Raspberry Pi Pico’s GPIO is powered from the on-board 3.3V rail and is therefore fixed at 3.3V.\\nThe Pico exposes 26 of the 30 possible RP2040 GPIO pins by routing them straight out to Pico header pins.

Powering Pico\\nThe simplest way to power Pico is to plug in the micro-USB, which will power VSYS (and therefore the system) from the 5V USB VBUS voltage, via D1 (so VSYS becomes VBUS minus the Schottky diode drop).\\nIf the USB port is the only power source, VSYS and VBUS can be safely shorted together to eliminate the Schottky diode drop (which improves efficiency and reduces ripple on VSYS).\\nIf the USB port is not going to be used, it is safe to power Pico by connecting VSYS to your preferred power source (in the range ~1.8V to 5.5V).\\n\\uf06a IMPORTANT\\nIf you are using Raspberry Pi Pico in USB Host mode (e.g. using one of the TinyUSB host examples) then you must\\npower Pico by providing 5V to the VBUS pin.\\nThe simplest way to safely add a second power source to Pico is to feed it into VSYS via another Schottky diode (see Figure 15). This will 'OR' the two voltages, allowing the higher of either the external voltage or VBUS to power VSYS, with the diodes preventing either supply from back-powering the other. For example a single Lithium-Ion cell* (cell voltage ~3.0V to 4.2V) will work well, as will 3×AA series cells (~3.0V to ~4.8V) and any other fixed supply in the range ~2.3V to 5.5V. The downside of this approach is that the second power supply will suffer a diode drop in the same way as VBUS does, and this may not be desirable from an efficiency perspective or if the source is already close to the lower range of input voltage allowed for the RT6150.\\nAn improved way to power from a\", doc_id='36537453-d006-4303-9baa-9ab177d14d4c', embedding=None, doc_hash='8b523b6777b3b2f175d4e75f0a0e7367172417d8078e1303800892537651c73a', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 36076, 'end': 37746}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'a019bc98-a3c8-4aa8-8238-32c7545e999d'}), score=1000.0), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text=' supply  to  RP2040  and  its  I/O,  generated  by  the  on-board  SMPS.

Pico  is  designed  to  be  usable  as  a  surface  mount module as well as being in Dual Inline Package (DIP) type format, with the 40 main user pins on a 2.54mm (0.1\") pitch grid with 1mm holes and hence compatible with veroboard and breadboard. Pico also has 4× 2.1mm (± 0.05mm) drilled mounting holes to provide for mechanical fixing, see Figure 3.\\n2.1. Raspberry Pi Pico pinout\\nThe Pico pinout has been designed to directly bring out as much of the RP2040 GPIO and internal circuitry function as possible,  while  also  providing  a  suitable  number  of  ground  pins  to  reduce  EMI  (Electro  Magnetic  Interference)  and signal crosstalk.

If the RP2040 is unpowered, applying a voltage to these GPIO pins will 'leak' through the diode into the VDDIO rail. GPIO pins 0-25 (and the debug pins) do not have this restriction and therefore voltage can safely be applied to these pins when RP2040 is unpowered up to 3.3V.\\n3.3. Using the ADC\\nThe  RP2040  ADC  does  not  have  an  on-chip  reference;  it  uses  its  own  power  supply  as  a  reference.  On  Pico  W  the ADC_AVDD pin (the ADC supply) is generated from the SMPS 3.3V by using an R-C filter (201Ω into 2.2μF).\\n1. This solution relies on the 3.3V SMPS output accuracy\\n2.

Surface-mount footprint\\nThe following footprint (Figure 5) is recommended for systems which will be reflow-soldering Pico units as modules.\\nThe footprint shows the test point locations and pad sizes as well as the 4 USB connector shell ground pads (A,B,C,D). The USB connector on Pico is a through-hole part, which provides it with mechanical strength. The USB socket pins do not protrude all the way through the board, however solder does pool at these pads during manufacture and can stop the module sitting completely flat. Hence we provide pads on the SMT module footprint to allow this solder to reflow in a controlled manner when Pico goes through reflow again.\\nFor test points that are not used, it is acceptable to void any copper under these (with suitable clearance) on the carrier board.\\n2.3.

If the RP2040 is unpowered, applying a voltage to these GPIO pins will 'leak' through the diode into the VDDIO rail. GPIO pins 0-25 (and the debug pins) do not have this restriction and therefore voltage can safely be applied to these pins when RP2040 is unpowered up to 3.3V.\\n3.3. Using the ADC\\nThe  RP2040  ADC  does  not  have  an  on-chip  reference;  it  uses  its  own  power  supply  as  a  reference.  On  Pico  W  the ADC_AVDD pin (the ADC supply) is generated from the SMPS 3.3V by using an R-C filter (201Ω into 2.2μF).\\n1. This solution relies on the 3.3V SMPS output accuracy\\n2.

GPIO0 to GPIO22 are digital only, and GPIO 26-28 can be used either as digital GPIO or as ADC inputs (software selectable).\\nGPIO 26-29 are ADC-capable and have an internal reverse diode to the VDDIO (3.3V) rail, so the input voltage must not exceed VDDIO plus about 300mV. If the RP2040 is unpowered, applying a voltage to these GPIO pins will 'leak' through the diode into the VDDIO rail. GPIO pins 0-25 (and the debug pins) do not have this restriction and therefore voltage can safely be applied to these pins when RP2040 is unpowered up to 3.3V.\\n3.3. Using the ADC\\nThe  RP2040  ADC  does  not  have  an  on-chip  reference;  it  uses  its  own  power  supply  as  a  reference.

USB\\nRP2040 has an integrated USB1.1 PHY and controller which can be used in both device and host mode. Pico W adds the two required 27Ω external resistors and brings this interface to a standard micro-USB port.\\nThe USB port can be used to access the USB bootloader (BOOTSEL mode) stored in the RP2040 boot ROM. It can also be used by user code, to access an external USB device or host.\\n3.8. Wireless interface\\nPico W contains an on-board 2.4GHz wireless interface using the Infineon CYW43439, which has the following features:\\n• WiFi 4 (802.11n), Single-band (2.4 GHz)\\n• WPA3\\n• SoftAP (Up to 4 clients)\\nThe antenna is an onboard antenna licensed from ABRACON (formerly ProAnt). The wireless interface is connected via SPI to the RP2040.\\nDue  to  pin  limitations,  some  of  the  wireless  interface  pins  are  shared.  The  CLK  is  shared  with  VSYS  monitor,  so  only when there isn’t an SPI transaction in progress can VSYS be read via the ADC. The Infineon CYW43439 DIN/DOUT and IRQ all share one pin on the RP2040. Only when an SPI transaction isn’t in progress is it suitable to check for IRQs. The interface typically runs at 33MHz.\\nFor best wireless performance, the antenna should be in free space. For instance, putting metal under or close by the antenna can reduce its performance both in terms of gain and bandwidth. Adding grounded metal to the sides of the antenna can improve the antenna’s bandwidth.\\nThere are three GPIO pins from the CYW43439 that are', doc_id='ff064b81-badb-40c9-83ec-0c109b5b0500', embedding=None, doc_hash='e3d234ceb61906444713c9a2e0a7de047a83f8681f1fe5181387e182f55bf795', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 40524, 'end': 42236}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'ad4a7438-342f-46c8-a529-288e7c5c951f'}), score=1000.0), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text=\" RP2040  has  an  on-chip  linear  regulator  (LDO)  that  powers  the  digital  core  at  1.1V  (nominal)  from  the  3.3V\\nsupply, which is not shown in Figure 14.\\n4.5. Powering Pico\\nThe simplest way to power Pico is to plug in the micro-USB, which will power VSYS (and therefore the system) from the 5V USB VBUS voltage, via D1 (so VSYS becomes VBUS minus the Schottky diode drop).\\nIf the USB port is the only power source, VSYS and VBUS can be safely shorted together to eliminate the Schottky diode drop (which improves efficiency and reduces ripple on VSYS).\\nIf the USB port is not going to be used, it is safe to power Pico by connecting VSYS to your preferred power source (in the range ~1.8V to 5.5V).\\n\\uf06a IMPORTANT\\nIf you are using Raspberry Pi Pico in USB Host mode (e.g. using one of the TinyUSB host examples) then you must\\npower Pico by providing 5V to the VBUS pin.\\nThe simplest way to safely add a second power source to Pico is to feed it into VSYS via another Schottky diode (see Figure 15). This will 'OR' the two voltages, allowing the higher of either the external voltage or VBUS to power VSYS, with the diodes preventing either supply from back-powering the other. For example a single Lithium-Ion cell* (cell voltage ~3.0V to 4.2V) will work well, as will 3×AA series cells (~3.0V to ~4.8V) and any other fixed supply in the range ~2.3V to 5.5V. The downside of this approach is that the second power supply will suffer a diode drop in the same way as VBUS does, and this may not be desirable from an efficiency perspective or if the source is already close to the lower range of input voltage allowed for the RT6150.\\nAn improved way to power from a\", doc_id='36537453-d006-4303-9baa-9ab177d14d4c', embedding=None, doc_hash='8b523b6777b3b2f175d4e75f0a0e7367172417d8078e1303800892537651c73a', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 36076, 'end': 37746}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'a019bc98-a3c8-4aa8-8238-32c7545e999d'}), score=1000.0), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text=\"cells  they  must  have,  or  be  provided  with,  adequate  protection  against  over-discharge,  over-\\ncharge, charging outside allowed temperature range, and overcurrent.

Using a battery charger\\nPico can also be used with a battery charger. Although this is a slightly more complex use case it is still straightforward. Figure 17 shows an example of using a 'Power Path' type charger (where the charger seamlessly manages swapping between powering from battery or powering from the input source and charging the battery, as needed).\\nIn the example we feed VBUS to the input of the charger, and we feed VSYS with the output via the previously mentioned P-FET  arrangement.  Depending  on  your  use  case  you  may  also  want  to  add  a  Schottky  diode  across  the  P-FET  as described in the previous section.\\n4.7.

Pico adds the two required 27Ω external resistors and brings this interface to a standard micro-USB port.\\nThe USB port can be used to access the USB bootloader (BOOTSEL mode) stored in the RP2040 boot ROM. It can also be used by user code, to access an external USB device or host.\\n4.8. Debugging\\nRaspberry Pi Pico brings the RP2040 Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface to a 3 pin debug header on the lower edge of the  board.  To  get  started  using  the  debug  port  see  the  Debugging  with  SWD  section  in  the  Getting  started  with Raspberry Pi Pico book.\\n\\uf05a NOTE\\nThe RP2040 chip has internal pull up resistors on the SWDIO and SWCLK pins, both nominally\", doc_id='19b3788e-26e8-4452-839c-b779b571432e', embedding=None, doc_hash='d6c49136450c835aa1df8205b378efca1389a703167ac7f10d006eeedfda1fcf', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 40978, 'end': 42765}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'a019bc98-a3c8-4aa8-8238-32c7545e999d'}), score=1000.0), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text=\"The following are knowledge triplets in the form of (subset, predicate, object):\\n('RP2040', 'has', '26 GPIO pins')\\n('Pico W', 'has', '26 GPIO pins')\\n('Pico W', 'has', '26-29 ADC-capable GPIO pins')\\n('RP2040', 'has', 'GPIO')\\n('GPIO24', 'is', 'IP')\", doc_id='3c4fd3e0-5143-4842-b091-cf44b7b5507d', embedding=None, doc_hash='75a12bd1f0e3317d1444919bddc259258422f9783c3d0907e6a2a5f1684f9487', extra_info=None, node_info={'kg_rel_texts': [\"('RP2040', 'has', '26 GPIO pins')\", \"('Pico W', 'has', '26 GPIO pins')\", \"('Pico W', 'has', '26-29 ADC-capable GPIO pins')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'GPIO')\", \"('GPIO24', 'is', 'IP')\"], 'kg_rel_map': {'used': [], 'GPIO': []}}, relationships={}), score=1000.0)], extra_info={'kg_rel_texts': [\"('RP2040', 'has', '26 GPIO pins')\", \"('Pico W', 'has', '26 GPIO pins')\", \"('Pico W', 'has', '26-29 ADC-capable GPIO pins')\", \"('RP2040', 'has', 'GPIO')\", \"('GPIO24', 'is', 'IP')\"], 'kg_rel_map': {'used': [], 'GPIO': []}})"

GPIO0 to GPIO22 are digital only, and GPIO 26-28 can be used either as digital GPIO or as ADC inputs (software selectable).\\nGPIO 26-29 are ADC-capable and have an internal reverse diode to the VDDIO (3.3V) rail, so the input voltage must not exceed VDDIO plus about 300mV. If the RP2040 is unpowered, applying a voltage to these GPIO pins will 'leak' through the diode into the VDDIO rail. GPIO pins 0-25 (and the debug pins) do not have this restriction and therefore voltage can safely be applied to these pins when RP2040 is unpowered up to 3.3V.\\n3.3. Using the ADC\\nThe  RP2040  ADC  does  not  have  an  on-chip  reference;  it  uses  its  own  power  supply  as  a  reference.  On  Pico  W  the ADC_AVDD pin (the ADC supply) is generated from the SMPS 3.3V by using an R-C filter (201Ω into 2.2μF).\\n1. This solution relies on the 3.3V SMPS output accuracy\\n2.

Programming the flash\\nThe on-board 2MB QSPI flash can be (re)programmed either using the serial wire debug port or by the special USB mass storage device mode.\\nThe simplest way to reprogram the Pico W’s flash is to use the USB mode. To do this, power-down the board, then hold the BOOTSEL button down during board power-up (e.g. hold BOOTSEL down while connecting the USB). The Pico W will then appear as a USB mass storage device.

Mechanical specification\\nThe  Pico  W  is  a  single  sided  51mm  ×  21mm  ×  1mm  PCB  with  a  micro  USB  port  overhanging  the  top  edge,  and  dual castellated/through-hole pins around the two long edges.

It also makes sure there is a little filtering even in the case that 3.3V and ADC_VREF  are  shorted  together  (which  is  a  valid  thing  to  do  if  you  don’t  care  about  noise  and  want  to  reduce  the inherent offset).\\nFinally, R7 is a physically large 1608 metric (0603) package resistor, so can be relatively easily removed if a user wants to  isolate  ADC_VREF  and  do  their  own  thing  with  the  ADC  voltage,  for  example  powering  it  from  an  entirely  separate voltage (e.g. 2.5V). Note that the ADC on RP2040 has only been qualified at 3.0/3.3V but should work down to about 2V. 4.4. Powerchain\\nRaspberry  Pi  Pico  has  been  designed  with  a  simple  yet  flexible  power  supply  architecture  and  can  easily  be  powered from  other  sources  such  as  batteries  or  external  supplies.  Integrating  the  Pico  with  external  charging  circuits  is  also straightforward. Figure 14 shows the power supply circuitry.\\nVBUS is the 5V input from the micro-USB port, which is fed through a Schottky diode to generate VSYS. The VBUS to VSYS diode (D1) adds flexibility by allowing power ORing of different supplies into VSYS.\\nVSYS is the main system 'input voltage' and feeds the RT6150 buck-boost SMPS, which generates a fixed 3.3V output for the RP2040 device and its IO (and can be used to power external circuitry).

GPIO0 to GPIO22 are digital only, and GPIO 26-28 can be used either as digital GPIO or as ADC inputs (software selectable).\\nGPIO 26-29 are ADC-capable and have an internal reverse diode to the VDDIO (3.3V) rail, so the input voltage must not exceed VDDIO plus about 300mV. If the RP2040 is unpowered, applying a voltage to these GPIO pins will 'leak' through the diode into the VDDIO rail. GPIO pins 0-25 (and the debug pins) do not have this restriction and therefore voltage can safely be applied to these pins when RP2040 is unpowered up to 3.3V.\\n3.3. Using the ADC\\nThe  RP2040  ADC  does  not  have  an  on-chip  reference;  it  uses  its  own  power  supply  as  a  reference.  On  Pico  W  the ADC_AVDD pin (the ADC supply) is generated from the SMPS 3.3V by using an R-C filter (201Ω into 2.2μF).\\n1. This solution relies on the 3.3V SMPS output accuracy\\n2.

To do this, power-down the board, then hold the BOOTSEL button down during board power-up (e.g. hold BOOTSEL down while connecting the USB). The Pico W will then appear as a USB mass storage device. Dragging a special '.uf2' file onto the disk will write this file to the flash and restart the Pico W.\\nThe USB boot code is stored in ROM on RP2040, so can not be accidentally overwritten.\\nTo get started using the SWD port see the Debugging with SWD section in the Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico book.\\n3.2.

There are SMT pads underneath the USB connector and BOOTSEL button, which allow these signals to be accessed if used as a reflow-soldered SMT module.\\nRaspberry Pi Pico W uses an on-board buck-boost SMPS which is able to generate the required 3.3V (to power RP2040 and external circuitry) from a wide range of input voltages (~1.8 to 5.5V). This allows significant flexibility in powering the unit from various sources, such as a single lithium-ion cell, or three AA cells in series. Battery chargers can also be very easily integrated with the Pico W powerchain.\\nReprogramming the Pico W flash can be done using USB (simply drag and drop a file onto the Pico W, which appears as a  mass  storage  device),  or  the  standard  serial  wire  debug  (SWD)  port  can  reset  the  system  and  load  and  run  code without any button presses.

Powerchain\\nPico W has been designed with a simple yet flexible power supply architecture and can easily be powered from other sources  such  as  batteries  or  external  supplies.  Integrating  the  Pico  W  with  external  charging  circuits  is  also straightforward.

The VBUS to VSYS diode (D1) adds flexibility by allowing power ORing of different supplies into VSYS.\\nVSYS is the main system 'input voltage' and feeds the RT6154 buck-boost SMPS, which generates a fixed 3.3V output for the RP2040 device and its I/O (and can be used to power external circuitry). VSYS divided by 3 (by R5, R6 in the Pico W schematic) and can be monitored on ADC channel 3 when a wireless transmission isn’t in progress.

The majority of the RP2040 microcontroller pins are brought to the user IO pins on the left and right edge of the board. Four RP2040 IO are used for internal functions - driving an LED, on- board Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) power control and sensing the system voltages.\\nPico  has  been  designed  to  use  either  soldered  0.1\"  pin-headers  (it  is  one  0.1\"  pitch  wider  than  a  standard  40-pin  DIP package) or can be used as a surface mountable \\'module\\', as the user IO pins are also castellated.

Pico also has 4× 2.1mm (± 0.05mm) drilled mounting holes to provide for mechanical fixing, see Figure 3.\\n2.1.

Surface-mount footprint\\nThe following footprint (Figure 5) is recommended for systems which will be reflow-soldering Pico units as modules.\\nThe footprint shows the test point locations and pad sizes as well as the 4 USB connector shell ground pads (A,B,C,D). The USB connector on Pico is a through-hole part, which provides it with mechanical strength. The USB socket pins do not protrude all the way through the board, however solder does pool at these pads during manufacture and can stop the module sitting completely flat. Hence we provide pads on the SMT module footprint to allow this solder to reflow in a controlled manner when Pico goes through reflow again.\\nFor test points that are not used, it is acceptable to void any copper under these (with suitable clearance) on the carrier board.\\n2.3.

This allows significant flexibility in powering the unit from various  sources  such  as  a  single  Lithium-Ion  cell,  or  3  AA  cells  in  series.  Battery  chargers  can  also  be  very  easily integrated with the Pico powerchain.\\nReprogramming the Pico Flash can be done using USB (simply drag and drop a file onto the Pico which appears as a mass  storage  device),  or  the  standard  Serial  Wire  Debug  (SWD)  port  can  reset  the  system  and  load  and  run  code without any button presses. The SWD port can also be used to interactively debug code running on the RP2040.\\nGetting started with Raspberry Pi Pico\\nThe Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico book walks through loading programs onto the board, and\\nshows how to install the C/C++ SDK and build the example C programs. See the Raspberry Pi Pico\\nPython SDK book to get started with MicroPython, which is the fastest way to get code running on Pico.\\n1.1.
